Diffusion on Complex Networks: Simulate diffusion processes on complex networks, such as information spreading or rumor propagation. Explore how different factors, such as node centrality, network topology, or initial conditions, affect the speed and reach of diffusion. Consider using models like the independent cascade model or the threshold model to simulate the diffusion dynamics.

Influence Maximization: Implement algorithms for influence maximization on graphs, such as the Independent Cascade Model or Linear Threshold Model. Find the optimal set of nodes to influence in order to maximize the spread of information, behaviors, or products in a social network. Analyze the effectiveness of different influence strategies and their dependence on graph properties.
